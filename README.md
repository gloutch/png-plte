## Documentation

As I tend to leave a project for several months straight,
I tough it would be nice to write some documentation using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html)
in order come back easier each time.

See each file begins with
```
/**
 * @file
 * @brief
 * @details
 */
```
And each function must be well described!
